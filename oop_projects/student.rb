    # INSTANCE VARIABLES âˆ’ Instance variables are available across methods for any particular instance or object. 
    # That means that instance variables change from object to object. 
    # Instance variables are preceded by the at sign (@) followed by the variable name.
    # They are also known as ATTRIBUTES - because we SET it then we ACCESS it

# when we run this file we see this: #<Student:0x00000000063af128> which is the 'object' and not really readable
# going back to method to_s() => we can define HOW to read that specifc object so that we can see some data
# in theroy, below should work however it does not!

# israel.first_name = "Israel"
# puts israel

# this would give an error => undefined method `first_name=' for #<Student:0x0000000006373218> (NoMethodError)
# since the variable known as israel is trying to use a method called first_name - first_name needs to be created!

# the way this method is used WORKS HOWEVER it is not the correct notation..

# israel.first_name("Israel")

# NOTE: what we changed to the FIRST first_name method (=) 
# UPDATE: now that we took away CLASSICAL setters and getters - the ATTRIBUTE ACCESSOR does it for us
# israel.first_name = "Israel"  # FINALLY should work!!
